      Festina Group is a watch company which, in 2007, decided to create a software development team to take care of the company needs. The team was created using most of the employees of its former consultancy. While working for Festina Group I was assigned to the Java team, newly created to establish the foundations for the future software development strategy of the company. In that period I was involved in the development of two tools:

      As a engineer in lead in the development of a web portal for the consultation of the technical information of the watches. This application integrated as well a shopping module that enabled workshops to purchase the parts they needed and consult past orders. My duties in that project were:
      - Design the application architecture.
      - Definition of the MYSQL database structure.
      - Implementation the user interface using JSF framework and ICEfaces component suit.
      - Implementation of the business logic and synchronization procedures using EJB3, JPA and our own API to access the ERP system.
      - Follow up and coordinate the tasks being done by the other members of the team.

      As a engineer in a standalone POS tool for the sales department. Prices, purchase orders, customer information, product description and images are remotely synchronized with the server via internet. My duties in that project were:
      - Definition of the architecture of the application.
      - Implementation of the user interfaces using swing.
      - Design and implementation of the client database and persistence using HSQLDB embedded database and Toplink JPA.
      - Implementation of the synchronization process between client and server using EJB3, web services and Toplink JPA.

      Multi-acces is an IT consultancy company providing integral services (from printers and hardware to tailor made ERP software). There I was trained for developing applications using their ERP system (Jbase a Pick derivate). For the two years expended in that company I was assigned to the team giving service to Festina Group. In that time I was exposed to all the aspects of the application (accounting, sales, statistics, customer, data definition, ...).

      My main duties:
      - Code maintenance.
      - Report creation.
      - Feature addition.
